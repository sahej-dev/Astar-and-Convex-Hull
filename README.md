# Astar-and-Convex-Hull
This contains my visual implementations of A* and Graham's Algorithm, which I made as a part of a project submission in my first year in university.

I have used the python version of a graphics library known as <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a>. Instruction on how to run a pde file in python mode can be found <a href="https://py.processing.org/tutorials/command-line/">here</a>. Just run the .pde files instead of the .py files.
